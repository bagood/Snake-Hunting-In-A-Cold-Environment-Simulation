# snake-hunting-mouse-simulation

Simulate a snake hunting a mouse in cold temperature. The cold temperature will have an affect to the snake. After some amount of time where the snake exposed by cold temperature, the snake will undergo hibernation for a little while.

This was the final project for my Mathematical Computation and Simulation Course. This project was quite challenging because of its complexities.

# Executions
